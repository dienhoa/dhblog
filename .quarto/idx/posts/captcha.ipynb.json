Let's see if we can classify a sequence of classes rather than a single one ;). \n\nIn this blog post, I will try to break the captcha using 3 different approaches.\n\n__In this blog post__:\n\n- Build captcha `Dataloaders` using Mid-level fastai API\n- Tweak number of outputs can solve the problem\n- Intuition about the receptive field and why we should remove the `AdaptiveAvgPool2d` layer \n- Sequential technique, Combining CNN + RNN -> CRNN with CTC Loss \n\nSpecial thanks to these references below for helping me out during this development:\n- [Fastai Captcha Recognition](https://augustasmacijauskas.github.io/personal-website/machine-learning/deep-learning/multi-output-) by Augustas Macijauskas\n- [CRNN-Pytorch repo](https://github.com/GitYCC/crnn-pytorch) by GitYCC\n\n\nIn this part, we will use the [Mid-Level API fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/11_midlevel_data.ipynb) to load data. This tool will help us to create `Dataloaders` which compatible with all the fastai ecosystems\n\nIn brief, we will create a `CaptchaTransform` ( similar to a [Pytorch Datasets](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/data_tutorial.html) ) which returns something showable (`CaptchaImage` in this case)\n\nTake a look at this [fastai tutorial](https://docs.fast.ai/tutorial.pets.html) for more details\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nBelow is the mapping from label to index and vice-versa. The index starts from `1` because we save the `0` for `UNKNOWN` class which is use in the last section `CNN + RNN`\n:::\n\n## An Image Classification Model with a tweak on output dimension\n\nA simple image classification model is used here with the output dimension: `Number_of_vocab x Number_of_classes`. Then, while calculating the loss function, we reshape the dimension and calculating the Cross-Entropy loss for each class (The fastai [CrossEntropyLossFlat](https://docs.fast.ai/losses.html#crossentropylossflat) can help you to specify which axis that you want to calculate the Cross-Entropy loss on)\n\n![simple tweak on output](attachment:image-2.png)\n\nWow! With this simple trick, we can reach 97% accuracy for the prediction 5-digits captcha. Very impressive! Let's see if we can do it better with other techniques\n\n## Remove the AdaptiveAvgPool2d to reserve spatial information\n\nIn the model used above, between the `body` and `head`, there is an `AdaptiveAvgPool2d` layer, which blurs all essential spatial information. So let's remove it and create our own `head`\n\n![Receptive field with and without Adaptive Average Pooling](attachment:image-3.png)\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Intuition\n\nFrom the Illustration above, we can see that, with `AdaptiveAvgPool2d`, each element in the feature vector must understand the whole Captcha, to classify correctly. To facilitate the work, by removing the Pooling layer,  each feature needs to represent only a part of the Captcha, or in the best case, a letter. Combining all the letter's features together can give us a Captcha prediction\n:::\n\nWe have a quite similar result to the previous model after 60 epochs. However, this one learns much faster. After 15 epochs, it attains already 43% captcha accuracy while the `With AdaptiveAvgPool2d` is still at 0% \n\n## CRNN + CTC Loss\n\nOne can imagine, from the intuition of the last section, if we can extract features from letters and then predict the captcha, How about using a `Recurrent Neural Network` (RNN)? Is it for solving sequence problems right? \n\nYes, yes, It is the CRNN.\n\n![CRNN Model](attachment:image.png)\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\nFeel free to run the model step by step through each layer to understand better the dimension \n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\nThe Sequence Length of the output doesn't necessarily equal to the Captcha Length (which is 5 in our case) because our loss function `CTC Loss` knows how to handle it\n\n:::\n\n\nThe `CNN-Body` model I use here is `resnet34`, but not the entire one. We cut it after some layers. The reason is, the deeper the image passes through the `CNN` the more its Width shrink, and it can not be smaller than our captcha length (which is 5). Below you can see I choose to cut after 7 layers so the feature's Width is still 13 (the last dimension of the tensor)\n\nBy running the `CNN` body manually, I can know the number of output features, height and width which will be used later for building the CRNN model\n\nThe loss function we use here is [CTC Loss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CTCLoss.html). In brief, it is a loss function that can handle a sequence classification without a specific alignment (Because we don't have a character-level dataset and the span of each character is random). An Illustration is below (Taken from https://sid2697.github.io/Blog_Sid/algorithm/2019/10/19/CTC-Loss.html). In CTC Loss, it allows a repeated prediction with a character that spans through multiple positions and also a blank character. However, we need a decoder to decode later the output. I will talk about it in the next section\n\n![CTC Loss Illustration](https://sid2697.github.io/Blog_Sid/assets/images/CTC_2.png)\n\n\n### Decoder and Metrics\n\nAs the output of CRNN model is not exactly corresponding to the Groud-Truth, we must have something to decode it and get the final prediction. Check this tutorial for more details https://towardsdatascience.com/beam-search-decoding-in-ctc-trained-neural-networks-5a889a3d85a7. Below there is code for the `greedy` and `beam-search` technique\n\nAs we can have a prediction from the decoder that has length > 5, we don't have character level accuracy for the metrics but only whole captcha accuracy\n\nOk, we have good results too. As it is a very simple dataset, it's hard to say which technique is better. However, the CRNN training loss is much lower than validation loss, It might be a hint that we can tune it to get more accuracy or training faster? Please DM me if you have an idea about it.
